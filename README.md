# TODO
A command line TODO management utility written in C++.

Written mostly as an exercise to learn C++ but also because I was unable to find an existing program that did what I wanted out of the box e.g. live display and file searching.

Inspired by similar projects such as [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/).
